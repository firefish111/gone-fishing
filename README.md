# Gone Fishing for MSDOS

This is the source code for the C edition of the Javascript game `gone fishing`. 

## How to compile

You can download the `.com` file from the releases tab or you can compile this yourself using a tool called [`OpenWatCom`](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2). You could also compile it using any other compiler, as long as it supports `cstdlib` and has support for `conio.h` (needed for `getch()` which works better than `getchar()`).
